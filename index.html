        A banana is an elongated, edible fruit (botanically a berry) produced by
        several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. In
        some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains",
        distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size,
        color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft
        flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow,
        red, purple, or brown when ripe. The fruits grow in clusters hanging
        from the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible seedless
        (parthenocarp) bananas come from two wild species – Musa acuminata and
        Musa balbisiana. The scientific names of most cultivated bananas are
        Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa × paradisiaca for the hybrid
        Musa acuminata × M. balbisiana, depending on their genomic constitution.
        The old scientific name for this hybrid, Musa sapientum, is no longer
        used.

      <h2>The History of the One and Only Banana</h2>
      <p>
        Bananas were originally found in South East Asia, mainly in India. They
        were brought west by Arab conquerors in 327 B.C. and moved from Asia
        Minor to Africa and finally carried to the New World by the first
        explorers andmissionaries to the Caribbean. The mass production of
        bananas started in 1834 and really started exploding in the late 1880’s.
        Before the 1870’s most of the land that bananas were grown on in the
        Caribbean had been previously used to grow sugar. After this time low
        marsh land started to be drained along with forests that were cleared in
        Central America for monocrops (which is growing one crop to increase
        productivity). In the early years of Central American banana trade the
        head of United Fruit had a marriage for political gain to the daughter
        of the Costa Rican President. This allowed his fruit company United
        Fruit to start acquiring the other fruit companies in the country. In
        the 1950’s when freely elected government of Guatemala threatened United
        Fruits control, United Fruit convinced the CIA that an overthrow was in
        order. The CIA placed a right-wing dictator loyal to United Fruit in
        power securing United Fruit’sposition in Guatemala.

        The first notable disease to strike bananas was a mold called Fusarium,
        it struck the roots of the Gros Michel which is avariety of bananas.
        Fusarium was also known as Panama Disease which was carried in the soil.
        In the 1920’s a second disease struck banana crops called Sigatosa,
        which is an airborne fungus. In the mind 1920’s United Fruit
        pathologists found that they could spray the plants with a “Bordeaux
        mixture” which is a pesticide, and it helped control the Sigatosa. The
        strategy to control Fusarium was to move banana plantations every ten
        years or so. Then researchers developed a banana that was immune to
        Fusarium, the Giant Cavendish, which is the variety that has come to
        dominate modern worldwide consumption, appeared in the 1950’s.
